# e-cook <br>
This is a repository for the CSE 583 Electric Cooking project in Kampala, Uganda. <br>

The purpose of this project is to develop a software to analyze, synthesize, and process data from electric meter sensors along with <br> individual surveys to understand trends with regards to power quality when electric cooking events are occuring in informal communities <br> in Kampala, Uganda. The software will output a dashboard with data visualization to assist researchers, inform <br> policies, enable decision-making for electric utilities, and provide usage information for informal community members.
