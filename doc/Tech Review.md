Background:
We are developing a data preprocessing/visualization framework to evaluate the quality of power in Kampala. 
This will be a tool for the use of researchers to develop a qualitative narrative.

Potential Software:

Data tools:
  1) Pandas -> easy to use existing framework for the processing of CSV files.

Visualization tools:
  1) Matplotlib -> existing knowledge of team
  2) Seaborn -> I want to learn it
