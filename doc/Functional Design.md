## Background
Developing communities are often subject to limited access to energy. This is particularly common when it comes to utilizing electricity as their primary energy source. Informal settlements often have a controversial relationship to electricity due to financial and social barriers. Community members in these settlements consider electricity to be “expensive”, “unsafe”, and “cause too many outages”. However, this usually results in individuals and families turning to alternative fuel sources for critical household tasks such as cooking. Often, charcoal and biomass become the predominant sources of fuel used in these communities for cooking. This poses serious health risks to individuals due to indoor air pollution which disproportionately impacts those that engage in domestic chores the most such as women and young girls.
 
Furthermore, the apprehension surrounding using electricity from a formal utility often results in community members seeking out local electricians to informally connect them to electricity services to reduce bill payments. Although these electricians are trusted individuals within the community, the informal connections can be completed in unsafe manner resulting in improper grounding, live and exposed wiring, as well as poor connection quality.
 
A study to examine electric cooking events in informal communities in Kampala, Uganda is currently being performed in which several settlements parsed over different geographic neighborhoods have been selected as case studies. Remote sensing smart electricity meters have been deployed at each of these homes to monitor trends in power consumption, voltage, and current levels when electric appliances are being used. These informal communities also have different modalities in which they are receiving electricity and the associated parties to whom they are paying for it. Through a series of household surveys, information on the electricity service was gathered from household members in each of the data set neighborhoods.
 
The purpose of the software package is to create a cohesive data visualization tool using data from the remote sensors as well as the surveys to understand trends in power consumption, quality, and voltage and frequency stability when electric cooking events are occurring. The visualization will aid various users in synthesizing and analyzing the data to inform decision-making surrounding policies on electrification in informal settlements. The data from Kampala can then be further extrapolated to apply to similar communities and scenarios on a global scale.

## Data Sources

Data inputs into the software will be of two different formats including csv files of smart meter data as well as survey responses. There are two types of smart meter sensors that have been deployed within the communities: A2EI and Kosko. Each of these meters have separate csv files with voltage, current, energy, power, and frequency measurements when electric cooking appliances are being used. These data sets will be disaggregated according to meter type and ID. Plots of each of these measurements will be compiled to aid in visualization and identify trends. Qualitative survey data will integrate with the quantitative meter data to identify and delineate consumption patterns across neighborhoods, connection modalities, electricity bill payments, as well as gendered use.


## Use Cases 
Use Case #1: Processing of large volumes of temporal data sets from smart meters.

Use Case #2: Integration of quantitative and qualitative data for synthesis and analysis.

Use Case #3: Data visualization for delineating trends in electricity consumption.

Use Case #4: Creating an interactive dashboard with toggle-able features to provide results catered to specific users.
